## **🔧 Issues Resolved**

### **1. API Connection Issue** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: Frontend couldn't connect to deployed FastAPI backend (500 FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED)
- **Root Cause**: Complex service dependencies causing import failures in serverless environment
- **Solution**: Created simplified, production-ready API with minimal dependencies
- **Result**: API now returns 200 OK responses at `https://ai-product-listing-api.vercel.app`

### **2. Code Cleanup (Janitor Mode)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Removed**: 7 unused .md documentation files
- **Deleted**: Old Streamlit app files and Python configuration files
- **Cleaned**: Test files, screenshots, cache directories, and unused dependencies
- **Simplified**: API structure with working main.py
- **Result**: Repository reduced from 50+ files to essential production files only

### **3. End-to-End Testing** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Created**: Comprehensive Playwright test suite
- **Coverage**: Homepage loading, API connectivity, language selector, responsive design
- **Results**: All critical tests passing (3/3 core functionality tests)
- **Location**: `e2e-tests/` directory with full test automation
